Hey people from the future! As you probably already now from the introduction, I am a student at TU/e currently enrolled in my second year. There will definitely come a time when I will write about my experience in the first year being a double bachelor, but that is not going to happen in this post. Here I want to talk about something more specific, namely, competitive programming and my limited journey through the depths of it. Probably unlike most people, I got involved problem solving using programming and techniques involved via [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/WOWnas) in September 2022, a platform for designated to coding practice and skill-building. I really enjoyed solving the problems and getting higher ranks, but I still was still **really** bad. I remember being frustrated when solving the harder problems, because I was getting **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** and I couldn't figure out why. I had no idea what *algorithmic time complexity* was at that time as I was a complete beginner. I remember complaining to my girlfriend that I know all of the solution, but for some reason my program is too slow. I had no idea that using a triple loop on an input measured in thousands would take too much time, when the problem was a dynamic programming one. Also, I couldn't understand the solutions to the problems so at some point I quit and switched to learning web development, which was not less frustrating, but still, a little bit more accessible, I would argue.

A year later, I got involved with it again via [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/WOWnas/)(This is my old account). It was August, just before my first year of studies. I then began to understand a little bit better what I was getting into. I started, of course, solving the easy problems first and trying and a couple of medium ones alongside of it. I remember them not being that challenging, but still requiring a little bit of practice. It certainly was the case because I have never done anything remotely close to this before. All of prior coding was following tutorials and doing a couple of bigger projects on my own, but completely unrelated and not having any sophisticated problems in need of efficient solutions. But before I could go on with experiencing a little bit more of such problem solving, the study year was just around the corner and very quickly my time and focus shifted to studying. It was all I did for around half a year, until I attended a lecture that completely changed that. During the break, a presentation was given, which invited Computer Science students to attend a small practice competition for first year students that was hosted by the **Competitive Programming and Problem Solving (CPPS) Honors Track**. I decided to go, since studying the university's pure material was taking the toll on me. I was very much humbled, but at the same time, surprised. I couldn't solve a single problem, or even if I thought I could, I just got **Wrong Answer (WA)** without really understanding why. However, I was not the only one like that. There was a number of people that didn't do good either, and since I had an impostor syndrome, it made me feel a little bit better about myself. On the other hand, there was a team of girls from Computer Science that solved almost all of the problems and as I learned later, they actually went to a Competitive Programming oriented Highschool, which is quite surprising. After the contest I learned a little bit more about honors tracks in general and realized that this is one, the CPPS track. After discussing my decision with my girlfriend and parents, I decided to apply for that. It a 2 year long track starting at the second year of a Bachelor Degree. It was the most popular track with quite a lot of applications (around 50 out of 300 students) and only 15 are accepted. Since I passed all the courses and had good grades, which were the requirements, I though I had at least some chance (although I had no confidence). 

This is where my real journey starts.
